## Introduction

These codes are about various parts of VO, and based on openCV2.4.9.

The images used in these codes are in the package "images".

Code in PT0045 is the first step of VO. Using the SURF to extract features.

Code in PT0046 is the second step of VO. Using two methods to matching features. And you can read the notes in code to change them.
